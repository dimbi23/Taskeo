# Taskeo - A simple task manager.
Simple task manager (really basic) made with [Flutter - Beautiful native apps in record time](https://flutter.dev/). It let you create task, add todo inside a task.

## UI
* We will use [google_fonts | Flutter Package](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts) package to manage fonts directly from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) repository.
* We will use [flutter_svg | Flutter Package](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg) package to use SVG assets exported from our design software.


## State management
We will use the famous Bloc Pattern from [flutter_bloc | Flutter Package](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) for state management.

## Data access
For data access, we will use repository pattern. It will add an abstraction layer on top of that data access. That layer will be very helpful when we want to reuse those repository interfaces.

* We will use [sqflite | Flutter Package](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite) package to persist data inside the device.
* [path_provider | Flutter Package](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider) to help us with the sqlite database path.

## Dependency injection (DI)
We will use [get_it | Dart Package](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) package for dependency injection.
