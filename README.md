# Taskeo - A simple task manager.
Simple task manager (really basic) made with Flutter. It let you create task, add todo inside a task.

## UI
This application will use [google_fonts | Flutter Package](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts) package to manage fonts directly from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) repository.

## State management
We will use the famous Bloc Pattern from [flutter_bloc | Flutter Package](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) for state management.

## Data access
For data access, we will use repository pattern. It will add an abstraction layer on top of that data access. That layer will be very helpful when we want to reuse those repository interfaces.
